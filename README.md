# Private Events

This is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) Ruby on Rails Curriculum.

It is a site to allow users to create and manage events. Users can create and attend events, while events can be attended by multiple users and have a specific date and location.

The idea is to practice the usage of models with many-to-many relationships.
